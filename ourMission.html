        With the presence of social media, social engagement and activism has become a popular method of educating 
        people on causes and campaigns. This can quickly lead to people being bombarded with campaigns through 
        videos or infographics. The information overload may cause negative effects on people's physical and 
        mental health as many lack trigger warnings.
