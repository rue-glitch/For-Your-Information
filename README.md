# For-Your-Information

Let us help you help the world!

With the presence of social media, social engagement and activism have become a popular method of educating people on causes and campaigns. This can quickly lead to people being bombarded with campaigns through videos or infographics. The information overload may cause negative effects on people's physical and mental health as many lack trigger warnings. 

For Your Information or FYI for short aims to create a safe virtual space for people to learn and support causes important to them. Resources such as campaign links and prevalent issues occurring in the world are compiled in an accessible way for users within this website. This website also aims to connect people with one another by providing help-lines and information to help others in need.
